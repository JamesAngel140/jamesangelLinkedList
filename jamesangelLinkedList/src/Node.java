 * Below is an explanation for the fancy stuff
 * attached to that type parameter.
 * For the assessment you do not need to know this,
 * but if you are curious: read on!
 * <p>
 * Because we want to be able to compare the elements
 * of the list with one another, we require that
 * class T implements the Comparable interface.
 * That interface has itself a type parameter, which
 * gives you what these values can be compared to.
 * The reason this is (in the most general case) not just T
 * itself is the following scenario:
 * class X implements the interface,
 * so we can compare Xs with Xs, then we define a subclass Y of X,
 * so it inherits the compareTo method from X,
 * but Ys are now compared with Xs.
